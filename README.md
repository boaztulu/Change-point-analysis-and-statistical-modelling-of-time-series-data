Great point! To keep **everything** in pure `.md` format, all sections—**including Output Example and Key Files**—should use Markdown tables, code blocks, or lists, *not* side comments or external formatting. Here is the **fully consistent Markdown README** with all sections in Markdown format:

# 📈 Brent Oil Price Change Point Detection

Welcome to the **Brent Oil Price Change Point Detection** project!  
This project analyzes log returns of Brent oil prices over time and detects **structural changes** using classical statistical modeling in Python with `statsmodels`.

---

## 🧠 Overview

This project:
- Loads and preprocesses Brent Oil historical price data
- Computes **log returns**
- Uses **residual sum of squares (RSS)** minimization to detect a **single change point**
- Visualizes both the **log return series** and the **price trend**, marking the detected change point

## 📦 Dependencies

Install required Python packages with:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib statsmodels
```

Or with conda:

```bash
conda install pandas numpy matplotlib statsmodels
```

---

## 📊 Dataset Format

Example of the required CSV format:

```csv
Date,Price
2020-01-01,65.37
2020-01-02,66.02
...
```

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Load and sort the Brent Oil price data
2. Compute log returns:

   $$
   r_t = \log(P_t) - \log(P_{t-1})
   $$
3. Loop through all valid change points:

   * Fit OLS models before and after each candidate point
   * Compute total RSS for each split
4. Select the change point with the minimum RSS
5. Visualize results: log returns and price series with the detected change point marked

---

## 🧪 Output Example

Example of what you’ll get after running the notebook:

```text
Detected Change Point Index: 467
Estimated Date: 2022-06-15
```

A plot will show a vertical dashed red line at the estimated change point in the price series.

## 📁 Key Files

| File                           | Description                  |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `data/BrentOilPrices.csv`      | Input CSV file of oil prices |
| `notebook/analysis.ipynb`      | Main Jupyter notebook        |
| `images/change_point_plot.png` | Output plot (optional)       |
| `README.md`                    | Project documentation        |

## 📸 Sample Plot

To save your plot, add this to your code:

```python
plt.savefig("images/change_point_plot.png")
```

You’ll see your result in the `images/` folder as `change_point_plot.png`.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone this repository and open the notebook:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/brent-change-point.git
cd brent-change-point
jupyter notebook notebook/analysis.ipynb
```
